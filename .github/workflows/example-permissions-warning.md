# Example: Properly Provisioned Permissions

This workflow demonstrates properly configured permissions for GitHub toolsets.

The GitHub MCP server always operates in read-only mode. The workflow uses three
GitHub toolsets with read permissions:
- The `repos` toolset uses `contents: read` for repository operations
- The `issues` toolset uses `issues: read` for issue management
- The `pull_requests` toolset uses `pull-requests: read` for PR operations

All required permissions are properly declared in the frontmatter, so this workflow
compiles without warnings and can execute successfully when dispatched.
